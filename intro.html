                    Hi, I’m  Harsh kumar, a first-year computer science student at CHandigarh  University. I’m passionate about web development and data analysis, and I’m always eager to learn new skills and technologies.

                    I have experience in creating websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I also have knowledge of SQL, Excel, Numpy and pandas for data manipulation and visualization. Some of the projects I have worked on include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A personal portfolio website that showcases my skills and achievements.</li>
                        <li>A stock price prediction using  LSTM model (ML)</li>
                        <li> A web scraper that collects and analyzes data from online sources.</li>
                        
                       

                    </ul>
                    <b>
                        I’m currently looking for internship opportunities in web development or data analysis where I can apply my knowledge and skills to real-world problems. I’m also open to collaborating with other developers on interesting projects.

                    In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, . 

                    If you want to know more about me or my work, feel free to contact me at <b>mister.harshkumar@gmail.com</b> or connect with me on LinkedIn.
